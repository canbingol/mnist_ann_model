 This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits, 
 and this model is trained to classify these digits into their respective categories (0-9). 
 The model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook. 
 Additionally, the trained model weights and other necessary files are included in this repository.
 This model can be used for digit recognition tasks and serves as an example of how to implement an ANN for image classification tasks.
